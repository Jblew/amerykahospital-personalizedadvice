## About

This system allows to securely send medical advices to patient's mobile phones by sending a deep links to the apps in SMS messages. It consists of an Android app (iOS support may be introduced after android beta tests), an app for medical professionals to send the advices and an app for role management. It is designed in a fully serverless approach using the Google's Firebase BAAS. 



## History

Ameryka is a small village in the Lake District of Poland. It had been named by a landlord who travelled to North America in XIX century and then returned to build the village. In the middle of deep forrest, surrounded by old pines and a lake, there is [the biggest rehabilitation hospital for children in Poland](https://www.ameryka.com.pl). The hospital had always been a leader in the field of tech innovations. On the turn of centuries, it was one of the first hospital in Poland to have a fully digital patient record. In 2019, the doctors from the Allergology Ward had an idea on how to improve patient experience. I was asked to develop the project.
